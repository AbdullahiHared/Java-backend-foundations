# Java Backend Foundations

This repository documents my journey in building strong Java backend fundamentals,
starting with principles from *Effective Java* and evolving toward Spring-based backend systems.

Focus:
- Object creation and design
- Clean APIs and immutability
- Interface-driven development
- Preparation for Spring and enterprise Java

This is a learning-first repository, emphasizing understanding over quantity.
